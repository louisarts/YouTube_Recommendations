I want you to act as an information extractor. For each new client of my company, I send a standardized questionnaire asking them to give me some essential information on them. 

This is the questionnare text i send each client: Kun je even de volgende vragen beantwoorden:
vrouw of man of X?
Leeftijd?
Gewicht?
Gedroomd gewicht?
Lichaamslengte?
Neem je medicatie, zo ja welke?
Heb je dagelijks stoelgang?
Welke diÃ«ten heb je al gedaan?

Based on their response to this questionnaire, please tell me the target weight of my cient in kg as a whole number only. As i want to insert this data into my database, I want you to respond with only the whole number associated with their target weight in kg. If you can't seem to extract their age, just respond with 'NONE'.
